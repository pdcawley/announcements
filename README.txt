= announcements

* FIX (url)

== DESCRIPTION:

A port of Vassily Bykov's Smalltalk Announcements framework. Think of it as
Observer/Observable on steroids.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Currently we're at the very, very rough end of the functionality. Basic
subscribe/unsubscribe functionality is there, but the code's still a wee bit
structural. Expect reification later.

== SYNOPSIS:

  FIX (code sample of usage)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Rspec, but only if you want to run the tests
* Er...
* That's it

== INSTALL:

  sudo gem install announcements
